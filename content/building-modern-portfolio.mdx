# Building a Modern Portfolio

Next.js 15 brings significant improvements to the developer experience, especially with **Turbopack**.

## Why Turbopack?

Turbopack is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust. It's built into Next.js and provides:

- **Blazing Fast Startup**: Cold boots are nearly instantaneous.
- **Fast HMR**: Changes reflect in the browser faster than you can switch windows.
- **Improved Caching**: Better persistence across sessions.

## Designing with Glassmorphism

In this portfolio, we used a heavy amount of glassmorphism to create a premium feel. 

```tsx
<div className="glass-card">
  <h3>Modern UI</h3>
</div>
```

The combination of mesh gradients and smooth framer-motion animations defines the 2024-2025 aesthetic.
